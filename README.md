# Best Slow Food

  Best slow food is an application we as a group of 5 students are
  developing during our bootcamp here in Craft Academy Gothenburg
  using ruby on rails.

  We're designing an app to make it easier for a restaurant owner and
  a customer to said restaurant to communicate by having system where
  you can both order or deliver food depending on your role.

  And if you're just looking for a certain style of food you can
  find restaurants of your choice using our app locating it on a map for you.

  You can take a look at it's current state right [**here**](https://url.com/)
