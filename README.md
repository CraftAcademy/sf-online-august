# Best Slow Food

  Best slow food is an application we as a group of 5 students are
  developing during our bootcamp here in Craft Academy Gothenburg.

  We're designing an app to make it easier for a restaurant owner and
  a customer to said restaurant to communicate by having system where
  you can both order or deliver food depending on your role.
